# Fitness

This web application let the users to add and continue to add workouts and keep track of their
progress over a week. This web application allows users to view, create and track daily
workouts. You will be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. You can also
be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a
cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
The database that I have used is mongoose db which is a NoSQL database. Which saves the last
workout, and the user can continue to add or create new workout.
The notification system that I used is Emailjs. It allows users to add their email address which
will get sent to my account and I can send the template email saying the workout have been
added.
The API that I used is a location search API. It fetches the location of the workout created or
added to track the workouts that have be added.
